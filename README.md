This is a simple Python script currently based on the Python Image Library which draws n-gons and n-grams by variable corner amount.

I created it quite some time ago, so the current code quality is not the best. I am still proud of this little project, though.

### To install all needed requirements simply run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Then to draw the n-(gon|gram) run
```
python ngon.py
```

## Plans for the future
- Rework it to also support output as .svg vector graphics
- Refactor the code to higher standards
